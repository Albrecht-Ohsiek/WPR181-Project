  <h1>Web Application Architecture</h1>  
  <p id="content">“Web application architecture defines the interactions between applications, middleware systems
    and databases to ensure multiple applications can work together.” Anon (2020). When a URL is
    searched in a browser then the corresponding page is requested through the internet. The data is
    then sent to the user for use. Web application architecture covers all external applications and subcomponents that enable web browsers to make sense of any inputs and instructions. Web
    applications are made up out of server-side engineering and the client-side.
